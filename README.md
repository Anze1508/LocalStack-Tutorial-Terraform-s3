# S3 Static Website with Terraform

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static website using Amazon S3, configured and managed through Terraform, within a local development environment facilitated by LocalStack. This approach allowed me to explore and understand the integration of cloud storage solutions with infrastructure as code (IaC) practices without incurring costs or deploying resources to the cloud.

## Key Learnings

1. Amazon S3 for Web Hosting: I learned how to use Amazon S3's capabilities to host static website content, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, leveraging S3's reliability and scalability.
2. Terraform Basics: I gained hands-on experience with Terraform, an open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.
3. LocalStack for Local Development: Using LocalStack, I simulated AWS cloud services on my local machine. This was invaluable for development and testing, allowing me to work offline and avoid AWS charges.

## Technologies Used
- Amazon S3: Used as the storage service for hosting the static website content.
- Terraform: Served as the IaC tool to define and provision the AWS resources needed for the static website, ensuring an easily reproducible and consistent infrastructure setup.
- LocalStack: Provided a local AWS cloud stack to develop and test cloud and serverless applications offline.

## Conclusion
This project was an excellent opportunity to combine cloud storage solutions with IaC practices, using Amazon S3, Terraform, and LocalStack. It highlighted the effectiveness of using Terraform for infrastructure management and the convenience of LocalStack for local development. The experience has equipped me with valuable skills for future cloud-based projects, emphasizing the importance of IaC in modern software development workflows.
